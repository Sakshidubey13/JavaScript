⚙️ How It Works
➕ Add Product

User enters product title, price, image URL, and category

Validation ensures title and price are required

Product is saved with a unique ID

👀 Display Products

Products are displayed dynamically in a table

Image, title, price, and category shown clearly

✏️ Edit Product

Clicking Edit loads data into the form

Changes are updated using product ID

❌ Delete Product

Product is removed instantly

UI updates smoothly with animation

💾 LocalStorage

Data remains saved even after page refresh

Uses localStorage.setItem() and getItem()
